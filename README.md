Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room is a videogame company currently working to transition their latest online game, Draw It or Lose It, from a single OS deployment to a multi-platform    deployment. The client has requested specfifically how this game can be integrated into the Windows NT, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS operating environments along with how this applications requirements can be met by various OS architectures. 
 
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  In this documentation I excelled at providing a variety of insights into each of the desired OSs' features. I also determined the best operating environment to prototype Draw It or Lose It for multi-platform online deployment.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  I found the best part of developing this design document to be the level understanding the document provides for the over-arching goal of the software package that generates are great sense of purpose when coding, since I will understand the various goals set to each handle, class, instance and driver. This document also outlines the issues involved when developing multi-platform applications since the developer will need to choose his/her tools wisely since the software package will need to access operating system handles for network access and other processes.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  If I were to revise any section of this document I would revisit the Domain Model section. I would refine it by altering my writing style so that the section is more engaging and expressive of the roles that each class member and function plays in the operation of Draw It or Lose It. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  The client stated the specific goal of transitioning their latest application, Draw It or Lose It, to an online multiplayer multi-platform appolication deployment; I included this request into my software design by utilizing the singleton method to ensure that no equivalent instances of a game session are active. It is paramount to understand your client's specific needs since software development involves the creation of a custom product designed to fulfill your client needs, so if your client's requests are not considered proper then your product will not provide the necessary functions and fail upon review or founder upon introduction to the market.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  When designing software I focus initially on determining the software packages goal(s) then I determine smaller goals that must be met to achieve the primary goal(s) of the software package. After sorting through the goals involved in the processes of the application, I will design the UML class diagram that provides me with the framework for later coding the application itself. In the future when analyzing and designing a similar application I will present costs for tools and development environments advised to my client so that they may forge the most appropriate decision for the application's requirements and budget.
